N Balances README
-----------------

Annual nitrogen mass balances calculated for each replicate block in the Kellogg Biological Station's Main Cropping System Experiment (KBS MCSE) from 1989 to 2021. Positive mass balances indicate net N inflow and negative mass balances indicate net N outflow.


Variate:				Description:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Year:				calendar year
2)  Treatment:			experimental treatment (T1, T2, T3, T4)
3)  Replicate:			replicate block within treatment
4)  Crop_year: 			the crop harvested that year (CORN, SOY, WHEAT)
5)  Percent_N_corn_seed:	%; percentage of corn seed mass comprised of N
6)  Percent_N_corn_stover:	%; percentage of corn stover mass comprised of N
7)  Percent_N_soy_seed:		%; percentage of soybean mass comprised of N
8)  Percent_N_soy_stover:	%; percentage of soy stover mass comprised of N
9)  Percent_N_wheat_seed:	%; percentage of wheat seed mass comprised of N
10) Percent_N_wheat_stover:	%; percentage of wheat stover mass comprised of N
11) Fert_N: 			kg/ha; total yearly N added to each replicate block via fertilizer application
12) BNF_soy:			kg/ha; total yearly N biologically fixed in each replicate block by soy, not including fixed N in soy seed
13) BNF_clover:			kg/ha; total yearly N biologically fixed in each replicate block by red clover
14) BNF_vetch:			kg/ha; total yearly N biologically fixed in each replicate block by vetch
15) Grain_N_corn:			kg/ha; total yearly N exported from each replicate block through corn harvest
16) Grain_N_soy:			kg/ha; total yearly N exported from each replicate block through soybean harvest, not including 
17) Grain_N_wheat:		kg/ha; total yearly N exported from each replicate block through wheat harvest
18) Grain_mass_corn:		kg/ha; total yearly biomass exported from each replicate block through corn harvest
19) Grain_mass_soy:		kg/ha; total yearly biomass exported from each replicate block through soy harvest
20) Grain_mass_wheat:		kg/ha; total yearly biomass exported from each replicate block through wheat harvest
21) N_balance:			kg/ha; difference between N additions and N exports in each replicate block
