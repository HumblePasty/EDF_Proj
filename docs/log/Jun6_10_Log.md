## The Harvest Parts

**Above earshank**: This refers to the parts of the plant above the point where the ear (the part of the plant that contains the seeds, such as corn kernels) is attached to the stalk.

**Below earshank**: This refers to the parts of the plant below the point where the ear is attached to the stalk.

**Cobs**: The central core of the ear of maize (corn) which holds the kernels.

**Grain**: The seeds of the plant, which are harvested for consumption or processing. In the case of maize, this refers to the corn kernels.

**Stover (all non-grain biomass)**: This term refers to all parts of the plant excluding the grain. This includes stems, leaves, husks, and tassels.

**Stems and leaves**: This refers to both the main stalk (stem) of the plant and its leaves.

**Husk**: The leafy outer covering of the ear of maize (corn).

**Stems**: The main structural support of the plant, commonly referred to as the stalk in maize.

**Leaves**: The green parts of the plant that are involved in photosynthesis.

**Tassel**: The male flower of maize that appears at the top of the plant and produces pollen.

**Roots**: The underground part of the plant that absorbs water and nutrients from the soil.

## How to Calculate C_p, C_s, C_r, C_e

form the harvest parts?

for each crop?

For corn

- C_p: the grain column
- C_s: strove column
- C_r: Harvest Index estimate
- C_e: coefficient
